How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

I interpret user needs by understanding what the user's goal is and what they want to gain from a product. User stories help with this 
because they help me develop a deeper understanding of the user's point of view and understand what I, as the developer, can implement into
the product to help the consumer achieve their goal.

How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

I approach developing games by working in small, organized sprints. Sprint planning is a good way for me to stay on track and focused
while keeping an eye on the smaller details. I also hope to incorporate regular stand-up meetings, retrospectives, and backlog grooming into my future development work to stay adaptable, improve continuously, and make sure I’m always prioritizing the most important tasks.
